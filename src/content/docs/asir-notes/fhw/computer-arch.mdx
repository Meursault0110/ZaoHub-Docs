## 1. Historical Introduction

### Early Computing Devices
- The abacus (circa 2000 BC) from ancient Mesopotamia
- The quipu system based on knots and strings
- 17th century mechanical calculators:
  - Pascal's Calculator (1642)
  - Leibniz Wheel (1672)

### Evolution of Calculating Machines
- Arithmometer (1820)
- Curta Calculator (1948)
- Spanish Minerva Calculator (1945)

:::note[Historical Note]
The transition from mechanical to electronic computing marked a revolutionary change in computational capabilities.

## 2. Computer Generations

<Steps>
1. **First Generation (1945-1955)**
   - Based on vacuum tubes
   - ENIAC and EDVAC computers
   - von Neumann architecture introduction

2. **Second Generation (1955-1965)**
   - Transistor-based computers
   - IBM 650 and 702 models
   - Room-sized computers weighing about 1 ton

3. **Third Generation (1965-1975)**
   - Integrated circuits
   - IBM S/360 and S/370
   - First storage devices (tapes and early hard drives)

4. **Fourth Generation (1975-1985)**
   - Microchips with thousands of transistors
   - Personal computers emerge
   - Apple I, II, and early IBM PCs

5. **Fifth Generation (1985-Present)**
   - Advanced microprocessors
   - Multi-core processing
   - Miniaturization and standardization
</Steps>

## 3. Von Neumann Architecture

The von Neumann architecture consists of these main components:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="CPU" icon="setting">
    - Control Unit (CU)
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
    - Registers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory" icon="document">
    - Main memory for instructions and data
    - Memory addressing system
  </Card>
  <Card title="I/O" icon="forward-slash">
    - Input/Output units
    - Peripheral management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buses" icon="random">
    - Data bus
    - Address bus
    - Control bus
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

:::caution[Von Neumann Bottleneck]
The main disadvantage of this architecture is the "von Neumann bottleneck" - the shared bus for instructions and data.
:::

## 4. Harvard Architecture

The Harvard Architecture differs by having:
- Separate memories for instructions and data
- Different buses for each memory type
- Capability for simultaneous instruction and data access

:::tip[Modern Application]
Harvard architecture is commonly used in microcontrollers and DSP chips.

## 5. Memory Hierarchy

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="CPU Registers">
    - Fastest access (1-2ns)
    - Very small capacity (1-32 bytes)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cache Memory">
    - L1, L2, L3 Cache
    - Access time: 5-50ns
    - Capacity: KB to MB range
  </Card>
  <Card title="Main Memory">
    - RAM
    - Access time: 25-100ns
    - Capacity: GB range
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secondary Storage">
    - HDDs and SSDs
    - Access time: 5-20ms
    - Capacity: TB range
