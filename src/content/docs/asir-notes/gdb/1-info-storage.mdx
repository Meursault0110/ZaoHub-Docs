## Introduction

In today's digital age, the demand for efficient data management has never been higher. This guide explores the evolution of information storage systems, from traditional file-based approaches to modern database-oriented solutions.

<Card title='Key Concept' icon='seti:smarty'>
  In computer science, data is any informative element relevant to a user. The field has continuously developed tools to facilitate data management, adapting computer interfaces to resemble familiar manual processes.

## Information Systems (IS)

Information Systems (IS) are the backbone of modern data management, integrating various elements to handle business information effectively.

## Data Storage Hierarchy

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Primary Storage">
    Fast, directly accessible by CPU (e.g., RAM)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Secondary Storage">
    Slower, higher capacity (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, USB drives)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Intermediate Storage">
    Buffer areas in main memory for efficient data transfer
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## File-based Systems

File-based systems were the original method of information storage in computer systems.

### Types of Files

<Steps>
1. **Plain Files**: Text-only files without formatting (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8)
2. **Direct Access Files**: Stored on addressable devices with a unique key field
3. **Indexed Files**: Similar to direct access, but with multiple key fields and sorted storage
</Steps>

## Database-oriented Information Systems

Modern information systems centralize data in a common database accessible by multiple applications.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
