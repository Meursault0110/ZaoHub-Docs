## Fundamental Concepts

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Basic Definitions">
		- **Computer Science**: Set of scientific knowledge and techniques that enable automatic information processing through computers.
		
		- **Computer**: Electronic machine that, through specific programs, allows storing and processing information, and solving various problems.
		
		- **Computer System**: Set of elements that enable capturing, storing, and processing data, composed of:
			- Hardware (physical component)
			- Software (logical component)
			- Human component
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Components">
		### Hardware (HW)
		- Physical/tangible part of the computer
		- Electronic components

		### Software (SW)
		- **Base Software**: Operating system programs
		- **User Software**: Programs for specific needs

		### Operating System (OS)
		Set of programs that manage hardware resources and offer them to users and user software.
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Operating System Objectives

:::tip[Main Objectives]
Operating systems have two fundamental objectives:
1. **Abstraction**: Hide hardware complexity
2. **Security**: Protect system integrity and data
:::

### Access Modes

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Protected Mode" icon="lock">
		Higher privilege level for OS programs
	</Card>
	<Card title="User Mode" icon="person">
		Restricted access for user programs
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Main Functions

<Steps>
1. **Process Management**
   - Hardware resource allocation
   - Concurrency control
   - Running program management

2. **Memory Management (RAM)**
   - Process distribution in memory
   - Address allocation
   - Free memory control

3. **File System Management**
   - File and folder storage
   - Indexing and structure
   - Disk space management

4. **I/O Management**
   - External device communication
   - Driver management
   - Communication protocols

5. **Security Management**
   - Access control
   - User hierarchies
   - Resource protection
</Steps>

## Types of Operating Systems

### By Structure

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Monolithic" icon="random">
		- Organized in single level
		- High performance
		- Difficult maintenance
	</Card>
	<Card title="Hierarchical" icon="seti:plan">
		- Organized by levels
		- Better error control
		- Lower performance
	</Card>
	<Card title="Hybrid" icon="puzzle">
		- Combined structures
		- Balance between performance and maintenance
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### By Capabilities

:::note[Classification]
Classified by:
- Number of users (single-user/multi-user)
- Number of tasks (single-task/multi-task)
- Number of processors (single-process/multi-process)
:::

### By Function

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Desktop OS" icon="seti:folder">
		For conventional users
	</Card>
	<Card title="Network OS" icon="seti:xml">
		For communication infrastructures
	</Card>
	<Card title="Distributed OS" icon="cloudflare">
		For large networked systems
	</Card>
	<Card title="Real-Time OS" icon="seti:clock">
		For immediate response
	</Card>

## Licenses and Costs

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="License Types">
		### Proprietary
		- OEM
		- Retail
		- VLK (Volume)

		### Free
		- GPL
