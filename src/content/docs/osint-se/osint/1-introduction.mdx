Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and leveraging publicly available information to gather intelligence. OSINT can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering information about potential threats, actors, and their activities.
- **Investigative Research**: Conducting in-depth investigations on individuals, organizations, or events.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Gathering information about competitors to gain a strategic advantage.
- **Cybersecurity**: Collecting data to enhance security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## OSINT Frameworks

OSINT frameworks are comprehensive sets of tools, techniques, and best practices for conducting OSINT investigations. Some popular OSINT frameworks include:

- **[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)**: A collection of various online tools and resources organized by category.
- **[Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/)**: A graphical tool for open-source intelligence and forensics.
- **[Bellingcat's OSINT Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit)**: A Google Sheets-based toolkit with various OSINT tools and resources.

These frameworks provide a structured approach to OSINT investigations and help researchers stay organized and efficient.

## üö¶ **Stages**
**OFM** is meant to be followed in a **top-down approach**, starting with the widest types and methods of searching for data and gradually implementing increasingly specialized tools and techniques. In the end, all the collected data is funneled into the **Data Process & Analysis** phase.

### üîç **STAGE 1: Search Engines**
- The main goal of this stage is to **collect more PII** (Personal Identifiable Information, e.g., email addresses and/or usernames) about the target. The discovery of new PII is useful both for **recursively searching the web** for more data on the target, as well as **feeding this PII to specialized OSINT tools** during Stages 2-5.
- This stage may sometimes collect **the most amount of data**, although this data may be quite scattered and raw in the absence of any kind of automation or filtering algorithm.
- For each search engine, **manual** or **automated** (API-based) **advanced search and scrape** methods can be applied to filter the results via built-in operators or patterns, and also to organize the data in structured formats e.g., **JSON**.
- Furthermore, **recursive searching and scraping** should be applied for each piece of **PII** collected during previous searches. This can be done best by using an automated tool.
- The **tools** used in this stage are the most **well-known search engines**, either queried manually or programmatically:
  - [Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search)
  - [Bing Advanced Search](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/advanced-search-keywords-ea595928-5d63-4a0b-9c6b-0b769865e78a)
  - [Yandex Advanced Search](https://yandex.com/support/search/query-language/search-operators.html)
  - [Yahoo Advanced Search](https://search.yahoo.com/web/advanced)
  - [DuckDuckGo Advanced Search](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/)
  - [Qwant Advanced Search](https://help.qwant.com/en/docs/qwant-search/searching/comment-utiliser-les-raccourcis-de-recherche-qwick/)
  - [Startpage Advanced Search](https://support.startpage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4521473758228-Advanced-Search-on-Startpage)
  - [Baidu Advanced Search](https://www.baidu.com/gaoji/advanced.html)
  - [Naver Advanced Search](https://www.naver.com/)
  - [Internet Archive Advanced Search](https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php)

Effective use of search engines is a fundamental part of OSINT. In addition to popular search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, researchers can utilize specialized search engines and techniques:

- **[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)**: A search engine for internet-connected devices and services.
- **[Censys](https://search.censys.io/)**: A search engine for internet-connected devices and hosts.
- **[Yippy](https://yippy.com/)**: A meta-search engine that combines results from multiple search engines.
- **[Google Dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)**: Advanced search queries that can uncover hidden or sensitive information.

### üõ†Ô∏è **STAGE 2: Specialized Tools**
- After the first wave of (more or less) relevant data has been collected and filtered from search engines, the next step is to use **specialized OSINT tools** on the most relevant bits of data that have been collected during Stage 1 (usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, profile URLs, etc.).
- These tools are meant as additional filters for the OSINT investigation; however, they can also provide **new insights and leads** on the target's online presence. Combining these tools with the advanced searches from the previous stage may already build a significant portion of the target's **digital footprint**.
- Some of the **tools** used in this stage are:

### üåê **STAGE 3: Social Avenues**
- The information collected in the previous two steps may point to one or more **social media profiles** that the target is using. These profiles may include, but not be limited to, well-known social media services such as **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **TikTok**, **X**, or **Reddit**, secondary or emerging social networks such as **Bluesky** or **Truth Social**, blogs, forums, or chat rooms such as **Telegram**, **Discord**, **Slack**, etc.
- Any of these avenues can lead to discovering more information about the target, either **personal** (age, birthday, photos, workplace, locations, friends) or **ideological** such as political, cultural, religious, or sexual preferences, among others. Any such lead can further unravel a suite of pathways to explore, and can also help paint a better picture of the target. This stage is **partly manual**, however the **tools** below may provide additional or faster insights.

üçÄ **NOTE:** There are hundreds of social media OSINT (**SOCMINT**) tools than have been developed over the years. Few of them still work (fully or partially) to this day, however most of them have not been maintained for years mostly because **social media platforms have become more restrictive** when it comes to their search functionality, API access and privacy measures. Therefore, any attempt to list all of these tools would be futile. Recently, more and more **specialized (paid) tools** emerged in the OSINT community and, even though some of them may not be affordable for most users, professional OSINT investigators will rely more and more on these solutions.

üçÄ **NOTE:** In the age of information and speed, **real OSINT investigators** would rather have a handful of (paid) specialized tools to rely on anytime, in combination with other tools and APIs mentioned throughout this methodology, than spend hours or days scouring through GitHub, Reddit or other places in search of a functional tool to do their job. The purpose of the **OFM** is to provide a pragmatic and useful path for conducting OSINT investigations, not to blindly list every available tool out there.

- Below you can find some general **SOCMINT** search tools that are **free** or **partially free**, as well as a list of **paid** tools which is going to be updated periodically.

  - **Specialized SOCMINT tools (Paid):**
    - [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/search/)
    - [SocialLinks](https://sociallinks.io/)
    - [SkopeNow](https://www.skopenow.com/)
    - [Neotas](https://www.neotas.com/)

    - [BlackDot](https://blackdotsolutions.com/social-network-analysis-tool/)
    - [BabelStreet](https://www.babelstreet.com/solutions/osint-threat-intelligence-platform)
    - [Spokeo](https://www.spokeo.com/)
    - [OSINT Industries](https://www.osint.industries/)
    - [IntelligenceX](https://intelx.io/tools)

Social media platforms are a rich source of OSINT data. Researchers can gather information from various social media sites, such as:

- **Facebook**: Profiles, groups, pages, and public posts.
- **Twitter**: Tweets, user profiles, and hashtags.
- **LinkedIn**: Professional profiles and connections.
- **Instagram**: Photos, videos, and user locations.

Tools like [Spiderfoot](https://www.spiderfoot.net/) and [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/) can help automate and streamline the collection of data from social media.

### üîê **STAGE 4: Data Breaches**
- Websites and APIs providing information and search capabilities on **data breaches and pastes** can sometimes prove to be extremely rewarding, especially if the previous steps have not provided a great deal of data about the target. Finding breaches that the target's username or email address has been a part of can provide crucial clues on some of the platforms where the target has (or at least had) accounts or profiles. Furthermore, this type of search can easily be **automated** via Python scripts and libraries, at very low API costs. Of course, this can again lead to manual research once one or more pieces of data have been found.
- Typical **tools** in this step are:
  
  - [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
  - [IntelligenceX](https://intelx.io/)
  - [Dehashed](https://dehashed.com/)
  - [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com/)
  - [LeakCheck](https://leakcheck.io/)
  - [CheckLeaked](https://checkleaked.cc/)
  - [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)
  - [H8Mail](https://github.com/khast3x/h8mail)
  - [IntelTechniques Breaches](https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Breaches.html)
  - [IntelTechniques Pastes](https://inteltechniques.com/tools/Pastes.html)

Many government agencies, organizations, and institutions make a wealth of information publicly available. OSINT researchers can explore these resources to gather relevant data, such as:

- **Property records**: Real estate ownership, property values, and tax assessments.
- **Court records**: Legal documents, case files, and criminal records.
- **Business registrations**: Company information, filings, and ownership details.
- **Professional licenses**: Licenses, certifications, and disciplinary actions.

### üïµÔ∏è **STAGE 5: Dark Web**
- Finally, in some cases there may be a need to touch the dark web, especially if the target potentially uses this environment for **unethical or illegal activities**. Most of the time, tapping into the rabbit holes of the dark web is unnecessary since 99% of the data resides on the **clear web**. This type of research is **mostly manual**, it's done through the **Tor network** and can expose the investigator to various **risks** if proper security measures are not implemented.
- Most common **Dark Web OSINT tools** include:
  
  - [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
  - [Onion Search](https://github.com/megadose/OnionSearch)
  - [Midnight Sea](https://github.com/RicYaben/midnight_sea)
  - [Darkus](https://github.com/Lucksi/Darkus)
  - [TorBot](https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot)
  - [GoTor](https://github.com/DedSecInside/gotor)

The dark web, a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines, can also be a source of OSINT data. However, accessing the dark web requires specialized tools and a thorough understanding of the risks involved.
