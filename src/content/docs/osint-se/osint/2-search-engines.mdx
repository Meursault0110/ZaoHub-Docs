# OSINT Search Engines Cheatsheet

## üîç Stage 1: Search Engines

The search engines stage is a critical foundation for effective OSINT research. The primary goals are to:

1. **Collect PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Gather email addresses, usernames, and other personally identifying details about the target.
2. **Recursive Searching**: Use the collected PII to recursively search for more information on the target.
3. **Feed OSINT Tools**: Provide the PII to specialized OSINT tools in subsequent stages for further analysis.

This stage can often yield the most raw data, though it may be scattered and unstructured without proper automation and filtering techniques.

          1. Utilize the advanced search features of popular search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.
          2. Leverage built-in operators and syntax to filter and refine your searches.
          3. Manually review, analyze, and organize the search results.
          4. Extract any PII (email addresses, usernames, etc.) for use in recursive searches.

          1. Develop scripts or use tools to programmatically query search engines via their APIs.
          2. Implement advanced filtering and extraction techniques to identify and structure relevant data.
          3. Automate the recursive searching process, using collected PII to find more information.
          4. Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for further analysis.

    <Steps>
      1. Utilize a variety of search engines, both general-purpose and specialized, to gather a comprehensive dataset.
      2. Employ both manual and automated techniques to filter, extract, and organize the search results.
      3. Continuously refine your search queries by incorporating the PII (email addresses, usernames, etc.) collected in previous searches.
      4. Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easy integration with other OSINT tools and workflows.
      5. Be mindful of search engine policies and limitations, and adjust your approach accordingly to avoid any potential issues.
