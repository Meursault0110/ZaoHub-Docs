# Understanding Operational Security

## Overview

Operational Security (OPSec) is a systematic approach to identifying critical information and determining the measures needed to protect assets and operations. This guide introduces fundamental OPSec concepts and best practices for beginners.

:::note[Historical Context]
The term "Operational Security" originated from military operations, where it was crucial to prevent adversaries from gathering intelligence about planned operations. Today, it's equally important in digital security.
:::

## Core Principles of OPSec

### 1. Risk Assessment
- Identify valuable assets and information
- Analyze potential threats and vulnerabilities
- Evaluate risk levels and potential impacts

### 2. Information Classification
- Determine sensitivity levels of different data types
- Establish handling procedures for each classification
- Implement need-to-know principles

### 3. Threat Analysis
